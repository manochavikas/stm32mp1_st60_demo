One time procedure:

1. Ready two DK2 boards with standard linux release e.g. v1.2.
Let's name:
	- one board: tx board
	- second board: rx board
2. Prepare a pen drive & copy the config files & scripts in it
3. Plug in the pen pen drive in any usb port of DK2.

or connect the board to internet &
wget https://github.com/manochavikas/stm32mp1_st60_demo/archive/v1.0_rc1.zip

tx board setup:
copy config_files/20-wired-tx.network in directory /etc/systemd/network/ using command
cp <your pen drive>/config_files/20-wired-tx.network /etc/systemd/network/

execute following command on console:
	systemctl restart systemd-networkd
	cp <your pen drive>/scripts/tx_stream.sh .
	chmod +x tx_stream.sh


rx board setup (similar procedure just change tx files to rx files):

copy config_files/20-wired-rx.network in directory /etc/systemd/network/ using command
cp <your pen drive>/config_files/20-wired-rx.network /etc/systemd/network/

execute following command on console:
	systemctl restart systemd-networkd
	cp <your pen drive>/scripts/rx_stream.sh .
	chmod +x rx_stream.sh

hardware setup:
- Connect both boards via ethernet cable
- Connect usb micro cable between stlink connector and host machine for
  console and interact with the board.
- Host machine : use Tera term (windows) or minicom(linux) to see logs
  and command entry
- Tera term/minicom configuration :
	Speed: 115200,
	Data : 8 bit,
	Parity: None,
	Stop bits: 1,
	Flow control: None
